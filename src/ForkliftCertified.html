                <p>In a world driven by AI one trucker named Dave refuses to be ruled by his robot overlords. Unfortunately for this causes Dave to lose his cushy trucking job since AI is said to be more “Efficent” and “Better” at doing his job. Naturally Dave moved on and started working at a warehouse as a forklift operator. The robot menace followed Dave to his new occupation and is once again threatening to take his job. One thing the AI’s didnt count on was Dave’s willingness to Fight Back!</p>
